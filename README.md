# README

In this archive, the iObserve project and the Software Engineering Group of Kiel
University provide a distributed version of the JPetStore. The application is
divided in one frontend service and three backend services which handle
account management, the catalog and the order operations.

Before we discuss any details, we want to thank the MyBatis team for providing
the JPetStore.

## Requirements

- Java 7 or higher
- git
- Maven 
- docker (optional)

## Preparation

After cloning our repository, select the `master` or `distributed-with-presentation-layer`
branch to get the distributed version without Kieker instrumentation. 
`git checkout distributed-with-presentation-layer`

Compile JPetStore with
`mvn clean compile package`

While `clean` is not necessary, it is helpful when you compiled it before and
want to ensure to start from a clean environment.

## Execution

After compilation and packaging you can deploy all packages in you own tomcat. However,
we also provide a `Dockerfile`. You can run either run `docker build` yourself or use
the `create-docker-images.sh` script to generate a docker image. In case you used the
`create-docker-images.sh` script, the image is named `single-jpetstore`.
